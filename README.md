# The Official Guide to aosheep’s Infinity Gauntlet Datapack V2.5.2

# Blank Infinity Gauntlet

The [Blank Infinity Gauntlet](#blank-infinity-gauntlet) doesn’t do anything on its own, but is still an essential part to obtaining the fully powered version.

## Crafting

To craft the [Blank Infinity Gauntlet](#blank-infinity-gauntlet), you need to [Forge](#forging) it by throwing 10 Gold Blocks, 3 Redstone Blocks, and the [Iron Hammer](#iron-hammer) on a lit Blast Furnace.


# Infinity Stones

The Infinity Stones are an essential part to making the fully [Powered Infinity Gauntlet](#powered-infinity-gauntlet). Like the [Blank Infinity Gauntlet](#blank-infinity-gauntlet), the stones do not do anything on their own, but are all essential to obtaining the whole Gauntlet.

## Crafting

To craft the Infinity Stones, throw a crafting table on top of an upwards facing barrel containing any one of the stones' recipe and push a piston downward onto the crafting table to craft that recipe’s respective stone inside the barrel.

Vanilla mob heads will not work for this recipe, though the mob heads from the firstrecommended Datapack will.)

# Powered Infinity Gauntlet

The Powered Infinity Gauntlet is the main attraction of this Datapack and allows the wielder to gain incredible powers that will be useful in daily life as well as in PVP battles. Because of its long creation process, it would be good sportsmanship just to give back a gauntlet to its rightful owner upon their death.

## Crafting

To craft the Powered Infinity Gauntlet, simply throw all six [Infinity Stones](#infinity-stones) on the ground along with the [Blank Infinity Gauntlet](#blank-infinity-gauntlet).

## Usage

Using the Powered Infinity Gauntlet is quite simple, though if the user is not careful, could result in an accidental death. Right-click (or place block key) with the Powered Infinity Gauntlet in your main hand to cycle through which [Infinity Stone](#infinity-stones) you are currently using. Hold shift (or sneak key) and right-click with the Powered Infinity Gauntlet in your off-hand to cycle through which [ability](#abilities) you are currently using (all stones except the [Mind Stone](#mind-stone) have more than one ability). Finally, right-click with the Powered Infinity Gauntlet in your off-hand to activate the selected ability. You can hold down right-click to continuously activate the selected ability.

# Power Infused Netherite Sword

The [Power Stone](#power-stone) and a Netherite Sword fused together to make the strongest weapon one can wield. As well as being unbreakable, it automatically comes with the enchantments: Sharpness IX, Looting III, Sweeping Edge III, Fire Aspect III, and Knockback III.
